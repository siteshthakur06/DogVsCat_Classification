# DogVsCat_Classification
Cat Vs Dog Image Classification Project | Deep Learning | CNN |
This code snippet is designed to show you the class names that Keras automatically assigned to the integer labels (0 and 1) when it loaded your images using image_dataset_from_directory | By running this code, you can verify if 'cats' and 'dogs' are correctly identified as the class names and in which order they are listed (which determines whether 0 is 'cat' and 1 is 'dog', or vice versa). This is important for interpreting your model's predictions.
